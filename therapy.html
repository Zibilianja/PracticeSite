        <p>
          Life is a difficult journey for everyone and each of us have our own
          strengths and limitations. Often we focus so much on our struggle that
          we ignore our strengths and forget how to appreciate life.
        </p>
        <p>
          We seek ways to avoid the discomfort of our daily lives, often by
          running from the weight of our past or avoiding the uncertainty of the
          future. There are many ways to escape in this world including food,
          substances, sex, money to name a few. As we get better at avoiding our
          discomfort, the feelings we push aside come out in the form of
          anxiety, depression, addiction or disorder.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to help you on your path to take the next step towards
          growth. All Grow focuses on functionality rather than dysfunction. By
          cultivating your natural wisdom, together we will find ways to work
          with the obstacles you face in your relationships, career, spiritual
          path and daily life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I welcome all spiritual, religious and cultural perspectives. By
          exploring our perspectives we can better understand the limitations
          and expectations of our beliefs and find a deeper sense of meaning and
          purpose in our lives. We will establish real goals, nurturing personal
          growth and bringing you into relationship with your authentic self.
