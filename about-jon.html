        <h1 class="left-headings"><u>About All Grow Counseling</u></h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          All Grow Counseling is a private practice started in 2018, working
          with people in a holistic way that helps to cultivate our strengths.
          The name All Grow Counseling is inspired by the garden metaphor in
          therapy.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The metaphor of a garden in the therapy context is a powerful one,
          ranging from the fragility of new growth and the need to continually
          tend to our growth, to the "manure" in our lives as fertilizer
          enabling growth. Pruning off older branches to encourage new and
          fruitful growth or growing food to help nourish ourselves and others.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          All of these metaphors can help inform the therapy process and can
          help us understand and conceptualize our own process.

        <br />
        <p>
          I grew up in Denver, Colorado and love the culture here and being so
          close to the mountains. I came back here from living on the west coast
          after my undergrad in 2013 and began working towards building a
          therapy practice.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I earned my BA at The University of Redlands, California in 2011,
          through a small liberal arts college called The Johnston Center for
          Integrative Studies. I studied psychology, religion, artistic
          expression and philosophy. I worked on combining these subjects into a
          custom degree entitled, "The Art of Being Human; a study of belief and
          expression."
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I earned my MA in Clinical Mental Health Counseling from Naropa
          University in Boulder in 2018, with an emphasis in Mindfulness Based
          Transpersonal Counseling Psychology. Naropa was a powerful
          transformative process that engages students in both sides of the
          therapy relationship so that we get experience of what it is like to
          be a client. I think this really helps to give Naropa Graduates a deep
          empathy for what it is like being in therapy, for our clients.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I completed my internship at People House in the Affordable Counseling
          Program, providing experience with a broad range of clients from
          diverse backgrounds. It was an enriching experience, helping me
          develop as a therapist and bringing me into private practice. I
          currently have my Licensed Professional Counselor Candidate status and
          am applying for licensure (LPC).
